# Cryptocurrency app

## Project name & pitch

The goal of the "Trashify" app is to support efficient waste segregation and recycling by making it easier for users to identify and locate appropriate waste bins. This app addresses the problem of the lack of easy access to information about trash bins, which often discourages people from properly segregating their waste. Utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning, "Trashify" aims to increase environmental awareness and promote responsible waste management behaviors.

### The application can be divided into four modules

1.  **Authorization Module**

    Allows users to log in and register in the app, also providing an option to recover a forgotten password.

2.  **Trash Bin Addition Module**

    This module enables the addition of new trash bin locations to the map in the app. The user can add a photo of the bin, which is analyzed by a machine learning model to recognize its type.

3.  **Home Page**

    Displays a map with marked trash bins, offering a search function and providing information about selected bins.

4.  **User Panel**

    Allows for the management of the user's personal data, editing app settings, changing the interface theme, and logging out.
